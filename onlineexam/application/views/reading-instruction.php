            <h1>You will need to read quickly and efficiently, and manage your time</h1>

            <p>You will be asked to read three different passages and respond to related questions in your IELTS Reading test.</p>
            
            <p>The content of the Reading test is different for&nbsp;<a href="https://takeielts.britishcouncil.org/choose-ielts/ielts-academic-or-ielts-general-training">IELTS Academic and IELTS General Training</a>&nbsp;tests. Details of each version are given below.</p>
            
            <h2>Purpose of the test</h2>
            
            <p>The IELTS Reading test is designed to assess a wide range of reading skills, including how well you</p>
            
            <ul><li>read for the general sense of a passage</li>
            	<li>read for the main ideas</li>
            	<li>read for detail</li>
            	<li>understand inferences and implied meaning</li>
            	<li>recognise a writerâ€™s opinions, attitudes and purpose</li>
            	<li>follow the development of an argument</li>
            </ul><p>This is the case for whichever version of the IELTS test you are taking.</p>
            
            <h3>Timing</h3>
            
            <p>The IELTS Reading test takes 60 minutes.</p>
            
            <p>You are not allowed any extra time to transfer your answers, so write them directly on to your answer sheet.</p>
            
            <p>You will need to manage your time during the test because you will not be told when to start or finish each section.</p>
            
            <h3>Three sections</h3>
            
            <p>You will be given three different passages to read, each with accompanying questions. You can expect to read 2,150 - 2,750 words in total during your test.</p>
            
            <h3>IELTS&nbsp;Academic&nbsp;Reading test</h3>
            
            <p>There are three sections to the IELTS Academic Reading test, and each contains one long text.</p>
            
            <p>These are taken from books, journals, magazines and newspapers. They have been written for a non-specialist audience and are on academic topics of general interest.</p>
            
            <p>They range from the descriptive and factual to the discursive and analytical.</p>
            
            <p>Each text might be accompanied by diagrams, graphs or illustrations, and you will be expected to show that you understand these too.</p>
            
            <p>A simple glossary is provided if the material contains technical terms.</p>
